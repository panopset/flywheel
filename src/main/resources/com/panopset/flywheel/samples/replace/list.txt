This example demonstrates the push, quit, replace, and line commands.

The replace command is used to replace the contents of any defined variable.  
We'll name our replacement variable x.

We're going to output each line with the line command, 
after definining what we want to replace,
and what we want to replace it with.

Note that the push and replace commands must be matched with a quit command.

In this template, we push the variable x with the ${p x} command, give it a 
value of "foo", and terminate the x definition with the ${q} command.
Then push a replacement of x with the value of bar, with the ${r x} command, 
similarly terminated with the ${q} command.

Finally, we use the ${l} command to output each line in this list.
